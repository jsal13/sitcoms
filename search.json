    "text": "Sitcoms\nThis is an introduction to Situational Comedies (Sitcoms). We’ll be using the theory as it applies to improv.\nA sitcom is [a radio or] television series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of comedic circumstances1. It is a shortening of situational comedy, and it is a genre of radio or television which has a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode and a narrative structure. The gist is that the set of characters are put into comedic situations and hilarity ensues.\nInstead of trying to pin down exactly what a sitcom is, we’ll look at a few examples of sitcoms through the decades.",

    "text": "1.2 I Love Lucy\n\nI Love Lucy is an American sitcom which began airing in 1951 and ended after 6 seasons (180 episodes). The show is set in an apartment building in NYC where Lucy and Ricky Ricardo rent an apartment from their landlords and best friends Fred and Ethel Mertz.\nThere are a number of common things that I Love Lucy does which other sitcoms also tend to do:\n\nSets up a problem (or two) for the episode with a clear, unambiguous problem statement.\n\n“Lucy, every single month your bank account is overdrawn!” Ricky implies that Lucy doesn’t appreciate money which leads to Lucy and Ethel going to work in a factory to learn the value of a dollar while Ricky and Ethel do the housework. At the end, everyone realizes that the other does a hard job and deserves respect.\n\nThe use of catch phrases.\n\n“Lucy, you got some ‘splainin’ to do!”\n\nCaricatured, broad characters.\n\nRicky is the protoypical “fish out of water” in that he is Cuban-American. This is used to comedic effect when he doesn’t quite know the correct English terms for things.\nLucy is a mischievous wife who is always getting into trouble and going behind her husband’s back to get what she wants.\n\nScenes which are functionally sketches.\n\nTo illustrate this last point, the Chcolate Factory Assembly Line — one of the most famous scenes from I Love Lucy — is functionally a sketch and could stand even if we didn’t know much about the characters.\n\nRemember, from above, that we have:\n\nRules: they’re at an assembly line that they have to keep up with.\nStakes: they need to do this correctly to keep their jobs.\nProblem: the assembly line starts going too fast.\nSolutions: eating the candy, putting the candy in front of them, etc.\nResolution: in this case, the scene ends without a strong resolution.\n\nAnother famous sketch-like scene is the Vitameatavegimen Commercial.\n\n\nRules: she needs to listen to the director and do her lines correctly in the commercial.\nStakes: she only gets paid if she does well.\nProblem: she starts getting tipsy after drinking some of it and can’t perform well\nSolutions: she attemps to act through her tipsiness.\nResolution: in this case, the scene ends without a strong resolution.\n\nNotice this also uses a phrase to call the audience back to how silly the scene is getting: “It’s so tasty, too!”",

    "section": "1.3 The Honeymooners",
    "text": "1.3 The Honeymooners\n\nDerived from Jackie Gleason’s sketch comedy show of the same name, The Honeymooners is about the daily lives of bus driver Ralph Kramden (notice the “blue collar” appeal to this!) and his wife Alice, along with their friends Ed and Trixie Norton. Notice the similarities to I Love Lucy: a married couple and their married friends get into zany schemes and problems in NYC.\nSimilar to Lucy, The Honeymooners has some of the same sitcom staples:\n\nSetting up a problem (or two) for the episode with a clear, unambiguous problem statement.\nThe use of catch phrases.\n\n“One’a these days, Alice… Bang, Boom, Straight to the Moon!”\n\nCaricatured, broad characters.\nScenes which are functionally sketches.\n\nWe’ll look at two scenes. The first is the famous Mambo scene, where Ralph does not want to learn the Mambo with Alice. The second is Blabbermouth where Ralph says nothing for the first three minutes of the sketch.\n\nNotice that there is a fair amount of physicality and clown-like movement in these (as well as in Lucy’s).",
