    "text": "Sitcoms\n\nThis is an introduction to Situational Comedies (Sitcoms). We’ll be using the theory as it applies to improv.\nA sitcom is [a radio or] television series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of comedic circumstances[^1]. It is a shortening of situational comedy, and it is a genre of radio or television which has a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode and a narrative structure. The gist is that the set of characters are put into comedic situations and hilarity ensues.\nInstead of trying to pin down exactly what a sitcom is, we’ll look at a few examples of sitcoms through the decades.",

    "text": "1.1 I Love Lucy\nI Love Lucy is an American sitcom which began airing in 1951 and ended after 6 seasons (180 episodes). The show is set in an apartment building in NYC where Lucy and Ricky Ricardo rent an apartment from their landlords and best friends Fred and Ethel Mertz.\nThere are a number of common “tools” that I Love Lucy uses which other sitcoms also tend to use:\nTo illustrate this last point, the Chcolate Factory Assembly Line — one of the most famous scenes from I Love Lucy — is functionally a sketch and could stand even if we didn’t know much about the characters.\nAnother famous sketch-like scene is the Vitameatavegimen Commercial.\nNotice this also uses a phrase to call the audience back to how silly the scene is getting: “It’s so tasty, too!”\nNotice that the sketches follow approximately the same format above. This is not a coincidence.",

    "text": "1.2 The Honeymooners\n\nDerived from Jackie Gleason’s sketch comedy show of the same name, The Honeymooners is about the daily lives of bus driver Ralph Kramden (notice the “blue collar” appeal to this!) and his wife Alice, along with their friends Ed and Trixie Norton. Notice the similarities to I Love Lucy: a married couple and their married friends get into zany schemes and problems. The Honeymooners also takes place in NYC.\nWe have similar “tools” as I Love Lucy:\n\nSetting up a problem (or two) for the episode with a clear, unambiguous problem statement.\nThe use of catch phrases.\n\n“One’a these days, Alice… Bang, Boom, Straight to the Moon!”\n\nCaricatured, broad characters.\nScenes which are functionally sketches.\n\nSimilar to above, we’ll look at two scenes. The first is the famous Mambo scene, where Ralph does not want to learn the Mambo with Alice. The second is Blabbermouth where Ralph says nothing for the first three minutes of the sketch.\nNotice how similar the sketches follows the pattern: Stakes of the Situation, Rules of the Situation, Problem occurs, Solutions are attempted, Problem is resolved, or there is a fade out.\nAdditionally, notice that there is a fair amount of physicality and clown-like movement in these (as well as Lucy’s).\n{{&lt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-FhWB1POWQ  &gt;}}",
