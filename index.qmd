# Sitcoms {.unnumbered}

![](friends.jpeg "F.R.I.E.N.D.S.")

This is an introduction to Situational Comedies (**Sitcoms**).  We'll be using the theory as it applies to **improv**.

A **sitcom** is [a radio or] television series that involves a continuing cast of characters in a succession of comedic circumstances[^1].  It is a shortening of _situational comedy_, and it is a genre of radio or television which has a **fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode** and a **narrative structure**.  The gist is that the set of characters are put into comedic situations and hilarity ensues.

Instead of trying to pin down exactly what a sitcom _is_, we'll look at a few examples of sitcoms through the decades.
